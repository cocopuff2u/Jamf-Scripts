# Password test window via swiftDialog

> Leverages `switftDialog` and Jamf Pro Scripts to easily display engaging end-user messages to test the local admin password.
> Some enviroments that require full SmartCard enforcement have no way of remind the users to test/remember the local password, this gives the user an easy prompt to test the password, while not using up the FailedLoginCount limit.
